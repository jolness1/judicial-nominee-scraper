On August 5, 2021, President Biden nominated Beth Robinson, currently a justice on the Vermont Supreme Court, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, to replace Judge Peter Hall, who passed away earlier this year. Before her near decade on the Vermont Supreme Court, Robinson was one of the leading litigators in the state. She was also a pathbreaking attorney in the marriage equality movement. As part of this effort, Robinson served as lead litigator on one of the movement’s first legal victories which led to Vermont becoming the first state to recognize civil unions. When confirmed in November 2021, Robinson became the first openly lesbian Court of Appeals Judge in the nation’s history.
