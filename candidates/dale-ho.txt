President Biden nominated Dale Ho to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 20, 2021. As one of the nation’s premier civil rights attorneys, Mr. Ho has spent his career fighting for our most critical constitutional rights and legal protections and is eminently qualified to serve as a federal judge. An accomplished litigator, Mr. Ho has extensive experience at every level of the Federal Court system, including twice arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court. The Southern District, which includes the boroughs of the Bronx and Manhattan and the northern NYC suburbs, covers one of the most populated and racially diverse regions in the entire nation. When he was confirmed on June 14, 2023, Dale Ho became one of only two Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) men sitting on the Southern District of New York.
