On January 10, 2022, President Joe Biden nominated Judge J. Michelle Childs to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to the seat being vacated by the retiring Judge David Tatel. Judge Childs has most recently distinguished herself as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. Before taking the bench, Judge Childs established expertise on labor and employment law in both private practice and state government. She also served as a state court judge in Columbia, South Carolina.

At the time of her confirmation to the District Court, Judge Childs was the third woman and third Black American to become a federal judge in South Carolina. She was confirmed to the District of Columbia Circuit on July 19, and she brings a wealth of legal experience and important demographic diversity to the court.
