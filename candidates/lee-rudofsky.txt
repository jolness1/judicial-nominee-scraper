On July 8, 2019, President Trump nominated Lee Rudofsky to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, for the seat previously held by Judge J. Leon Holmes . Rudofsky’s record paints a clear picture of a partisan warrior bent on curtailing critical rights and protections for everyday people. His nomination conforms to the Trump Administration’s stated goal of appointing judges who will assist in tearing down civil rights, health care access, environmental protections, workers’ rights, consumer protections, and the federal agencies that enforce them. Born in 1979, Rudofsky is among the many young lawyers Trump has nominated to serve on the federal bench. This is consistent with the Trump Administration’s strategy of naming ever-younger individuals to lifetime appointments on the federal bench to ensure a rightward tilt to our justice system for decades to come.
