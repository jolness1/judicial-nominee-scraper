On February 15, 2018, President Trump nominated Michael Y. Scudder, Jr. to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Scudder is nominated to fill the seat previously held by Richard Posner, who retired on September 2, 2017.

Scudder worked for the Department of Justice and in the White House on national security issues during the George W. Bush presidency. His time there overlapped with the Bush Administration’s concerning stances on executive power and civil liberties, including the rights of detainees. The Senate should carefully examine Scudder’s record before confirming him to a seat on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
