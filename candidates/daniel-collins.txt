On November 13, 2018, President Trump nominated Daniel P. Collins to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for the seat previously held by Judge Harry Pregerson. The Senate did not act on Collins’s nomination before the end of the Congress, and on January 3, 2019, Collins’s nomination was returned to the President. On February 6, 2019, President Trump renominated Collins.

Collins’s record offers no evidence that if he is elevated to the federal bench, he could act as a fair-minded and neutral arbiter. His record shows that he has fought to undermine civil liberties, weaken women’s reproductive rights, and criticized important Supreme Court decisions necessary for a just criminal justice system. Moreover, he has carved out a career as the go-to lawyer for a host of entities accused of discrimination, egregious human rights violations, and endangering the health and safety of persons in the U.S. and abroad.
