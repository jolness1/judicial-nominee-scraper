In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Colorado Supreme Court Justice Allison Hartwell Eid for the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.  Eid’s nomination defied the recommendation of the Judicial Conference of the United States, which creates guidelines for the administration of the federal courts, that the vacancy on the Tenth Circuit not be filled due to lack of caseload. In his rush to fill a seat the bipartisan Judicial Conference has recommended be left vacant, President Trump did not consult with Senator Michael Bennet, as past Presidents did with home-state senators of the other party. Instead, the Trump Administration selected an ideologically-driven jurist who will undoubtedly carry out an ultraconservative agenda when elevated to the federal bench.

Since her confirmation to the Tenth Circuit, Eid has argued to dismiss a case involving the killing of Marquez Smart, who had done nothing wrong, was unarmed, and like the rest of the crowd around him, was running away from gunfire when officer Lee Froese shot him.

The Alliance for Justice strongly opposes the consideration of Allison Eid for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.
