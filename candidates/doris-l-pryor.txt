On May 25, 2022, President Biden nominated Judge Doris L. Pryor, who currently serves as a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Southern District of Indiana, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Prior to joining the bench, Judge Pryor worked as a public defender for the state of Arkansas and served in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana. If confirmed, Judge Pryor would be the first woman of color from Indiana to serve on the Seventh Circuit and would join fellow President Biden-appointee, Judge Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, as the only judges of color currently sitting on the Seventh Circuit.
