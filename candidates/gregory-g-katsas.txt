On September 7, 2017, President Trump nominated Deputy White House Counsel, Gregory G. Katsas, to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

There is no doubt why the President nominated Katsas. There are countless seasoned Republican lawyers who would be qualified to sit on the D.C. Circuit, the nation’s “second highest court.” The reason for Katsas’s nomination, however, appears to be his role as a Trump loyalist and a White House insider, who by his own account could have had a hand in almost all legal actions and decisions undertaken by the Trump Administration.

Indeed, Katsas describes his role as providing advice to the President and his staff “on virtually any legal issue of interest.” Given this fact, Katsas must demonstrate that he will be independent of the President who nominated him, and has an obligation to clarify his involvement crafting and implementing some of the most troubling actions taken by any President in history.

Katsas’s career has also been defined by advocating for virtually unchecked executive power, trying to weaken civil rights laws, and working to eviscerate critical protections for the environment, workers, consumers and investors.

Alliance for Justice strongly opposes his confirmation to the District of Columbia Circuit.
