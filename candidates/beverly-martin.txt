Judge Martin has a distinguished professional history. She graduated from Stetson University in 1976 and the University of Georgia Law School in 1981. After law school, she worked in private practice at Martin Snow, LLP in Macon, Georgia, where she handled business transactions and criminal appointments. In 1984, she moved to Atlanta to serve as an assistant attorney general for the state of Georgia. She began a three year period in 1994 as a federal prosecutor focusing on drug conspiracy, firearms possession, and counterfeiting cases. She was appointed acting U.S. attorney, and then later confirmed by the Senate as U.S. attorney in 1998.

President Clinton nominated her to serve on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in 2000, where she has served since. Judge Martin has, on many occasions, sat by designation on the court to which she is nominated. Her decisions evidence a careful attention to facts and law, and her rulings are well within the legal mainstream.

This year, the American Bar Association’s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave Judge Martin its highest rating of “well qualified.”
