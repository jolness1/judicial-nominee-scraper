On May 23, 2024, President Biden nominated Justice Julia M. Lipez to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.


Background

Lipez currently serves as a justice on the Maine Superior Court. She earned her J.D., with distinction, from Stanford Law School in 2006, and her B.A., magna cum laude, from Amherst College in 2002.

Upon graduating from law school, Lipez clerked for Judge Diana Gribbon Motz on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. After her clerkship, she worked first as an associate and then as a senior associate at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP in New York. From 2011 to 2022, Lipez served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maine. In 2019, she was promoted to the prestigious role of Appellate Chief. After over a decade working as a U.S. Attorney, Lipez was appointed to the Maine Superior Court in 2022. Lipez is the daughter of Judge Kermit V. Lipez, who served on the First Circuit in Maine. President Biden’s elevation of Lipez to the First Circuit demonstrates the administration’s commitment to further strengthening the gender diversity of the federal courts.
