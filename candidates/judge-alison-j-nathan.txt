On November 18, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated current U.S. District Court Judge Alison J. Nathan to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Judge Nathan is nominated to the seat being vacated by Judge Rosemary Pooler, who is retiring. Before her decade-long service on the District Court, Judge Nathan had a distinguished career in private practice, academia, and government service. When she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to her current position in 2011, Judge Nathan was only the third openly LGBTQ+ federal judge ever confirmed by the Senate. If confirmed to the Second Circuit, she will become the second openly LGBTQ+ woman to serve on any federal circuit court.
