Alliance for Justice strongly opposed the confirmation of Cory Wilson to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Wilson called the Affordable Care Act “illegitimate” and “perverse” and made clear that courts should invalidate the law and take away health care from millions.  He called civil rights organizations “rent-a-mobs.” He denounced claims of voter suppressions as “poppycock” and championed measures to make it harder for African Americans to vote.

Wilson’s record as a legislator, his prolific presence of social media, and his op-ed writings, paint a picture of a deeply partisan political actor. In fact, much of his record consists of dutifully parroting the right wing media’s talking points of the day. He lamented the imagined “war on Christmas,” criticized “King Barack” and repeated the “Crooked Hillary” nickname.

On June 24, 2020, with near unanimous Republican support, he was confirmed to the Fifth Circuit.
