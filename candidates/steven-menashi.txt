On August 14, 2019, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Steven Menashi to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for the seat previously held by Thurgood Marshall, and most immediately held by Judge Dennis Jacobs.  If confirmed, the Second Circuit will contain six Democratic appointed judges and six Republican appointed judges, with one other pending Trump nominee.

Based on his history of inflammatory rhetoric and the work he has done throughout his legal career, Alliance for Justice believes Menashi, if confirmed, will erode critical rights and legal protections. He will protect the wealthy and the powerful, not the rights of all Americans. Because little in Menashi’s ultraconservative career suggests he will be a fair-minded nonbiased jurist, Alliance for Justice strongly opposes his confirmation and calls on every senator to oppose. Every senator who votes for his confirmation will own Menashi’s vile quotes and positions contained in this report.
