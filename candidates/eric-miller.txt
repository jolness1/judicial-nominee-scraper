On July 19, 2018, President Trump nominated Eric D. Miller to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals seat previously held by Judge Richard C. Tallman in Washington state.

Miller’s nomination is strongly opposed by both national organizations and local tribes, as a result of his career spent fighting tribal interests and tribal sovereignty. Neither home state senator supports his nomination.

In private practice, Miller has frequently represented powerful corporations fighting the interests of consumers and employees. At the Justice Department, his work as a career attorney included several controversial national security and reproductive rights cases.

Miller’s personal comments and writings also raise questions about whether he understands the impact of the law on real people, or simply prefers that the law protect the wealthy few. And like many Trump nominees, Miller is a member of and speaker at the extremely conservative Federalist Society.

Based on our review of his record and career, Alliance for Justice strongly opposes Miller’s nomination.
