Bill Lewis began his legal career clerking for Judge John Bush (2003–2004) before serving as an Assistant District Attorney in Alabama’s Nineteenth Judicial Circuit (2004–2005). He then entered private practice, first as an associate attorney at the Law Office of Jeff Courtney (2005–2006), and later as a general practitioner at his own firm, the Law Office of Bill Lewis (2006–2016).

Key Facts

In a presentation on artificial intelligence and the legal profession, Justice Lewis asserted that “the survival of our nation depends on the use of originalism as a judicial approach,” further claiming that members of the legal community who do not adopt originalism are “result oriented” and undermine “the standards of a civil society.” Lewis has also stated that “there is no race in the law,” signaling his commitment to a so-called “color-blind” approach. This framework has historically been invoked to weaken civil rights protections and to dismiss the disparate impact laws have on racial minorities.
